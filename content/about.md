title: A Little About Me
---

Hello! My name is Emre. I am currently studying Computer Science at Durham University and am enthusiastic about pursuing research in quantum computing or algorithmic complexity theory. I thoroughly enjoy working on side projects and passion projects, especially those related to operating systems. I aspire to one day acquire the skills to contribute to large-scale open-source projects and develop a career in freelancing.

Additionally, I tutor mathematics in my spare time. I am deeply familiar with the A-level and IGCSE mathematics syllabi and have had the pleasure of tutoring students from my former school for various durations.
