Hello, I'm Emre! Undergraduate computer science student and freelancer on the side. I like the idea of going into research in this field and am primarily interested in algorithms and everything operating systems.

<br>
<br>
I like working on CPU emulators in my spare time (I really wanna emulate Pokemon Red)
